I am currently pursuing my Master's in Data Analytics Engineering at George Mason University.I am a Data Science Enthusiast and
a dedicated analytical professional with excellent problem-solving skills and having over 3 years of experience as a highly analytical and process-oriented data analyst with in-depth knowledge of data warehousing concepts,ETL, data modeling, reporting and visualization.

At Mason I opted courses like Applied Predictive Analytics, Deep Learning, Principles of Data Management and Mining, Database Management Essentials, Analytics & Decision Analysis, Information: Representation, Processing and Visualization, Analytics: Big Data to Information, Applied Statistics and Visualization for Analytics and Determining Needs for Complex Big Data Systems. All these courses really helped me understand the concepts of data analytics and how it is being leveraged in different fields. In addition, I am currently working on my capstone project that is based on computer vision and deep learning the details of which can be found on my LinkedIn profile.

 My specific interests include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Visualization, and Data Mining. This portfolio is to keep track of how I started my journey of setting foot in Data Science and what I am learning as I dive deeper.If there are any positions that you would like to discuss or have any suggestions reach me at gunnalavamshi@gmail.com.
